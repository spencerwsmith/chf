## this is the skeleton of all *ajax* pages on our site - page snippets that are retrieved with Ajax.
## it's primary function is to insert the CSS and JS for the template hierarchy the ajax return
## is composed of.

## set up a StaticRenderer object to enable the CSS/JS automatic inclusion magic.
<%! from django_mako_plus.controller import static_files %>
<%  static_renderer = static_files.StaticRenderer(self) %>

## render the CSS for this template
${ static_renderer.get_template_css(request, context)  }

## render the ajax content
<%block name="content">
    Sub-templates should place their ajax content here.
</%block>  

## render the JS for this template (placed here at the end because browsers apparently load faster when JS is at the end)
${ static_renderer.get_template_js(request, context)  }
